Lighthouse is an **Ethereum 2.0 client** that connects to other Ethereum 2.0
clients to form a resilient and decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain.

We implement the specification as defined in the
[ethereum/eth2.0-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) repository.

## Topics

You may read this book from start to finish, or jump to some of these topics:

- Follow the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) to install Lighthouse.
- Get hacking with the [Development Environment Guide](./setup.md).
- Utilize the whole stack by starting a [local testnet](./local-testnets.md).
- Query the [RESTful HTTP API](./api.md) using `curl`.


Prospective contributors can read the [Contributing](./contributing.md) section
to understand how we develop and test Lighthouse.

## Validator and Beacon Logs

The logs page provides users with the functionality to access and review recorded logs for both validators and beacons. Users can conveniently observe log severity, messages, timestamps, and any additional data associated with each log entry. The interface allows for seamless switching between validator and beacon log outputs, and incorporates useful features such as built-in text search and the ability to pause log feeds.

Additionally, users can obtain log statistics, which are also available on the main dashboard, thereby facilitating a comprehensive overview of the system's log data. Please note that Siren is limited to storing and displaying only the previous 1000 log messages. This also means the text search is limited to the logs that are currently stored within Siren's limit.

# Late Block Re-orgs

Since v3.4.0 Lighthouse will opportunistically re-org late blocks when proposing.

This feature is intended to disincentivise late blocks and improve network health. Proposing a
re-orging block is also more profitable for the proposer because it increases the number of
attestations and transactions that can be included.

## Command line flags

There are three flags which control the re-orging behaviour:

* `--disable-proposer-reorgs`: turn re-orging off (it's on by default).
* `--proposer-reorg-threshold N`: attempt to orphan blocks with less than N% of the committee vote. If this parameter isn't set then N defaults to 20% when the feature is enabled.
* `--proposer-reorg-epochs-since-finalization N`: only attempt to re-org late blocks when the number of epochs since finalization is less than or equal to N. The default is 2 epochs,
  meaning re-orgs will only be attempted when the chain is finalizing optimally.

All flags should be applied to `lighthouse bn`. The default configuration is recommended as it
balances the chance of the re-org succeeding against the chance of failure due to attestations
arriving late and making the re-org block non-viable.

## Safeguards

To prevent excessive re-orgs there are several safeguards in place that limit when a re-org
will be attempted.

The full conditions are described in [the spec][] but the most important ones are:

* Only single-slot re-orgs: Lighthouse will build a block at N + 1 to re-org N by building on the
  parent N - 1. The result is a chain with exactly one skipped slot.
* No epoch boundaries: to ensure that the selected proposer does not change, Lighthouse will
  not propose a re-orging block in the 0th slot of an epoch.

## Logs

You can track the reasons for re-orgs being attempted (or not) via Lighthouse's logs.

A pair of messages at `INFO` level will be logged if a re-org opportunity is detected:

> INFO Attempting re-org due to weak head      threshold_weight: 45455983852725, head_weight: 0, parent: 0x09d953b69041f280758400c671130d174113bbf57c2d26553a77fb514cad4890, weak_head: 0xf64f8e5ed617dc18c1e759dab5d008369767c3678416dac2fe1d389562842b49

> INFO Proposing block to re-org current head  head_to_reorg: 0xf64fâ€¦2b49, slot: 1105320

This should be followed shortly after by a `WARN` log indicating that a re-org occurred. This is
expected and normal:

> WARN Beacon chain re-org                     reorg_distance: 1, new_slot: 1105320, new_head: 0x72791549e4ca792f91053bc7cf1e55c6fbe745f78ce7a16fc3acb6f09161becd, previous_slot: 1105319, previous_head: 0xf64f8e5ed617dc18c1e759dab5d008369767c3678416dac2fe1d389562842b49

In case a re-org is not viable (which should be most of the time), Lighthouse will just propose a
block as normal and log the reason the re-org was not attempted at debug level:

> DEBG Not attempting re-org                   reason: head not late

If you are interested in digging into the timing of `forkchoiceUpdated` messages sent to the
execution layer, there is also a debug log for the suppression of `forkchoiceUpdated` messages
when Lighthouse thinks that a re-org is likely:

> DEBG Fork choice update overridden           slot: 1105320, override: 0x09d953b69041f280758400c671130d174113bbf57c2d26553a77fb514cad4890, canonical_head: 0xf64f8e5ed617dc18c1e759dab5d008369767c3678416dac2fe1d389562842b49

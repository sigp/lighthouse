# System Requirements

Lighthouse is able to run on most low to mid-range consumer hardware, but will perform best when
provided with ample system resources. The following system requirements are for running a beacon
node and a validator client with a modest number of validator keys (less than 100).

## Minimum

* Dual-core CPU, 2015 or newer
* 8 GB RAM
* 128 GB solid state storage
* 10 Mb/s download, 5 Mb/s upload broadband connection

During smooth network conditions, Lighthouse's database will fit within 15 GB, but in case of a long
period of non-finality, it is **strongly recommended** that at least 128 GB is available.

## Recommended

* Quad-core AMD Ryzen, Intel Broadwell, ARMv8 or newer
* 16 GB RAM
* 256 GB solid state storage
* 100 Mb/s download, 20 Mb/s upload broadband connection

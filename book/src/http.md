# HTTP API

A Lighthouse beacon node can be configured to expose a HTTP server by supplying the `--http` flag. The default listen address is `localhost:5052`.

The following CLI flags control the HTTP server:

- `--http`: enable the HTTP server (required even if the following flags are
	provided).
- `--http-port`: specify the listen port of the server.
- `--http-address`: specify the listen address of the server.

The API is logically divided into several core endpoints, each documented in
detail:

Endpoint | Description |
| --- | -- |
[`/beacon`](./http_beacon.md) | General information about the beacon chain.
[`/validator`](./http_validator.md) | Provides functionality to validator clients.
[`/consensus`](./http_consensus.md) | Proof-of-stake voting statistics.
[`/network`](./http_network.md) | Information about the p2p network.

## Troubleshooting

### HTTP API is unavailable or refusing connections

Ensure the `--http` flag has been supplied at the CLI.

You can quickly check that the HTTP endpoint is up using `curl`:

```
curl "localhost:5052/beacon/head"

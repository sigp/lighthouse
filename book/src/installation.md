# ðŸ“¦ Installation

Lighthouse runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via [WSL][] only).

There are three core methods to obtain the Lighthouse application:

- [Pre-built binaries](./installation-binaries.md).
- [Docker images](./docker.md).
- [Building from source](./installation-source.md).

Additionally, there are two extra guides for specific uses:

- [Rapsberry Pi 4 guide](./pi.md).
- [Cross-compiling guide for developers](./cross-compiling.md).

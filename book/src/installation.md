# ðŸ“¦ Installation

Lighthouse runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

There are three core methods to obtain the Lighthouse application:

- [Pre-built binaries](./installation-binaries.md).
- [Docker images](./docker.md).
- [Building from source](./installation-source.md).

Community-maintained additional installation methods:

- [Homebrew package](./homebrew.md).
- Arch Linux AUR packages: [source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lighthouse-ethereum),
  [binary](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lighthouse-ethereum-bin).

Additionally, there are two extra guides for specific uses:

- [Raspberry Pi 4 guide](./pi.md).
- [Cross-compiling guide for developers](./cross-compiling.md).

node and a validator client with a modest number of validator keys (less than 100).

* Dual-core CPU, 2015 or newer
* 8 GB RAM

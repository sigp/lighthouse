//! Provides the `BeaconProcessor`, a mutli-threaded processor for messages received on the network
//! that need to be processed by the `BeaconChain`.
//!
//! Uses `tokio` tasks (instead of raw threads) to provide the following tasks:
//!
//! - A "manager" task, which either spawns worker tasks or enqueues work.
//! - One or more "worker" tasks which perform time-intensive work on the `BeaconChain`.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! The purpose of the `BeaconProcessor` is to provide two things:
//!
//! 1. Moving long-running, blocking tasks off the main `tokio` executor.
//! 2. A fixed-length buffer for consensus messages.
//!
//! (1) ensures that we don't clog up the networking stack with long-running tasks, potentially
//! causing timeouts. (2) means that we can easily and explicitly reject messages when we're
//! overloaded and also distribute load across time.
//!
//! ## Detail
//!
//! There is a single "manager" thread who listens to two event channels. These events are either:
//!
//! - A new parcel of work (work event).
//! - Indication that a worker has finished a parcel of work (worker idle).
//!
//! Then, there is a maximum of `n` "worker" blocking threads, where `n` is the CPU count.
//!
//! Whenever the manager receives a new parcel of work, it either:
//!
//! - Provided to a newly-spawned worker tasks (if we are not already at `n` workers).
//! - Added to a queue.
//!
//! Whenever the manager receives a notification that a worker has finished a parcel of work, it
//! checks the queues to see if there are more parcels of work that can be spawned in a new worker
//! task.

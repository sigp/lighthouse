//! Provides a mechanism which queues work for later processing.
//!
//! When the `beacon_processor::Worker` imports a block that is acceptably early (i.e., within the
//! gossip propagation tolerance) it will send it to this queue where it will be placed in a
//! `DelayQueue` until the slot arrives. Once the block has been determined to be ready, it will be
//! sent back out on a channel to be processed by the `BeaconProcessor` again.
//!
//! There is the edge-case where the slot arrives before this queue manages to process it. In that
//! case, the block will be sent off for immediate processing (skipping the `DelayQueue`).
//!
//! Aggregated and unaggregated attestations that failed verification due to referencing an unknown
//! block will be re-queued until their block is imported, or until they expire.

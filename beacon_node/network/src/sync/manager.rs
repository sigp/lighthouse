//! The `SyncManager` facilities the block syncing logic of lighthouse. The current networking
//! specification provides two methods from which to obtain blocks from peers. The `BlocksByRange`
//! request and the `BlocksByRoot` request. The former is used to obtain a large number of
//! blocks and the latter allows for searching for blocks given a block-hash.
//!
//! These two RPC methods are designed for two type of syncing.
//! - Long range (batch) sync, when a client is out of date and needs to the latest head.
//! - Parent lookup - when a peer provides us a block whose parent is unknown to us.
//!
//! Both of these syncing strategies are built into the `SyncManager`.
//!
//! Currently the long-range (batch) syncing method functions by opportunistically downloading
//! batches blocks from all peers who know about a chain that we do not. When a new peer connects
//! which has a later head that is greater than `SLOT_IMPORT_TOLERANCE` from our current head slot,
//! the manager's state becomes `Syncing` and begins a batch syncing process with this peer. If
//! further peers connect, this process is run in parallel with those peers, until our head is
//! within `SLOT_IMPORT_TOLERANCE` of all connected peers.
//!
//! ## Batch Syncing
//!
//! See `RangeSync` for further details.
//!
//! ## Parent Lookup
//!
//! When a block with an unknown parent is received and we are in `Regular` sync mode, the block is
//! queued for lookup. A round-robin approach is used to request the parent from the known list of
//! fully sync'd peers. If `PARENT_FAIL_TOLERANCE` attempts at requesting the block fails, we
//! drop the propagated block and downvote the peer that sent it to us.
//!
//! Block Lookup
//!
//! To keep the logic maintained to the syncing thread (and manage the request_ids), when a block needs to be searched for (i.e
//! if an attestation references an unknown block) this manager can search for the block and
//! subsequently search for parents if needed.

//! The `BeaconProposer` cache stores the proposer indices for some epoch.
//!
//! This cache is keyed by `(epoch, block_root)` where `block_root` is the block root at
//! `end_slot(epoch - 1)`. We make the assertion that the proposer shuffling is identical for all
//! blocks in `epoch` which share the common ancestor of `block_root`.
//!
//! The cache is a fairly unintelligent LRU cache that is not pruned after finality. This makes it
//! very simple to reason about, but it might store values that are useless due to finalization. The
//! values it stores are very small, so this should not be an issue.

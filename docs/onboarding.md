# Learn how to contribute to ETH 2.0!

Lighthouse is an Ethereum 2.0 client built in Rust.

If you are interested in contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem, and you want to learn Rust, Lighthouse is a great project to work on.

Initially this doc will contain reading material to help get you started in Rust and Ethereum. Eventually it will have guides specific to Lighthouse.

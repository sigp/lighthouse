The beacon node is not required to validate the signed IndexedAttestation, and a successful response (20X) only indicates that the broadcast has been successful. The beacon node is expected to integrate the new attestation into its state, and therefore validate the attestation internally, however attestations which fail the validation are still broadcast but a different status code is returned (202)"

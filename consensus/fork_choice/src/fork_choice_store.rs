/// Approximates the `Store` in "Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 -- Beacon Chain Fork Choice":
///
/// https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/v0.12.1/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#store
///
/// ## Detail
///
/// This is only an approximation for two reasons:
///
/// - This crate stores the actual block DAG in `ProtoArrayForkChoice`.
/// - `time` is represented using `Slot` instead of UNIX epoch `u64`.
///
/// ## Motiviation
///
/// The primary motivation for defining this as a trait to be implemented upstream rather than a
/// concrete struct is to allow this crate to be free from "impure" on-disk database logic,
/// hopefully making auditing easier.

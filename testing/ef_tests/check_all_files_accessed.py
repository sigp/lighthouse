# The purpose of this script is to compare a list of file names that were accessed during testing
# against all the file names in the consensus-spec-tests repository. It then checks to see which files
# were not accessed and returns an error if any non-intentionally-ignored files are detected.
#
# The ultimate goal is to detect any accidentally-missed spec tests.
